# CovidCases

Hi! I'm new to programming, and that's my first bigger project.
I made this in one day.
This is Java program to check in pie chart situation about Covid-19 in countries.
You just have to write name of the country in English and click button. 
I would be glad if you tell me, what I could do better or how to make my code clearer.
Thanks!
